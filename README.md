## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/debjohnson/taskly.git
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the app

```bash
npm start
```

4. You will need to link your Expo app to the app on your phone or download the simulator of your choice.

For looking at the app on your phone, you'll need to get the Expo Go app on your phone, open it and scan the QR code that comes up after running the app to link it to your phone.

To use a simulator for iOS, you'll need the Xcode app. For Android, you'll need Android Studio.
